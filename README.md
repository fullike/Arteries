# Arteries
Arteries is a procedural modeling toolkit base on UE4 blueprint. By using this plugin you can implement the whole modeling procedure in UE4 blueprint graph without any other modeling software.\
To implement a modeling procedure is rather simple. Just creating a blueprint inherited from ArteriesActor and implement its OnBuild event. In the event graph you can create a serial of different geometry operation nodes and any logic you want to build the final geometry.

### Features
- Runtime procedural generation.
- Multi-threaded.
- Most of common geometry operations.
- Per Point/Primitive/Geometry lua code snippet for custom operations.
- Point/Primitive group.
- Point/Primitive custom attributes.
- Tangent space and UV coordinates generation.
- Static mesh instancing during placement.
- Full source code provided.
